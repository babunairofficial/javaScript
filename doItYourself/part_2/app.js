/* Arrays */

//arrays are similar to variables
//arrays are used to assign multiple values with respect to each index
//index number starts with 0

var cities = ["Mumbai", "Delhi", "Kolkata", "Chennai"];

// arrays can be assigned have mixed values in different indexes
var mixedArray = [1, "India", 2, "Asia", 29, "Earth"];

//naming of arrays follows the same rules of a variable
//cities[0] = "Mumbai"
//cities[3] = "Chennai"

console.log("3rd element is having index 2, the value is " + cities[2]);
