/* Functions */

//functions are a block of code that needs to be executed multiple times, by invoking its name

//create a function named 'multiply' to find the product of two numbers
function multiply() { 
    var a = prompt("enter the value of a");
    var b = prompt ("enter the value of b");
    var prod = a * b;
    alert ("product of numbers is " + prod);    
}

//call the function 
multiply();

//note: naming of functions is similar to naming a variable, it follows the same properties.
