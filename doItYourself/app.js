/*alerts*/

alert("Welcome to Javascript"); 
//alert is a keyword. 
// within parenthesis we have a text string in double quotes (or even single quotes will do)
//each line ends with a semicolon, except when curly brackets are used

window.alert("alert using longer version");
//alternatively window.alert can be used instead of the shorter version.
