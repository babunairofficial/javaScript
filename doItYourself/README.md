# Learning JavaScript
    This repository tracks my progress as I work through the book "A Smarter Way to Learn JavaScript".

# 1. Alert keyword
    Learned about the alert keyword.
    Practiced creating simple alert dialogs.
# 2. Variables
    Learned how to declare variables using var. (let and const too can be used)
    Practiced assigning values and updating variables.
    Using variables instead of values
# 3. Variables for Numbers
    Learned how to store numeric values in variables.
    Practiced assigning numeric values and updating variables for numbers.
    Learned how alert keyword displays variables assigned to numbers.
# 4. Legal and illegal Variable Names
    Explored legal variable names (e.g., userName, _count, $total).
    Identified illegal variable names (e.g., 2name, my-variable, var).
# 5. Familiar Mathematical Expressions
    Practiced using basic arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %).
# 6. Unfamiliar Mathematical Operators
    Learned about increment (++) and decrement (--) operators.
    Practiced pre-increment (++variable) vs post-increment (variable++).
    note: similar for pre-decrement and post-decrement.  
# 7. Math Expressions - Eliminating Ambiguity
    Learned how to use parentheses () to control the order of operations.
    Practiced grouping expressions to ensure correct calculations.
    Explored JavaScript's default operator precedence and how to override it.
# 8. Concatenating Text Strings
    Learned how to combine strings using the + operator.
    Explored string concatenation with variables.
    Practiced combining numbers and strings in expressions.
# 9. Prompts
    Learned how to use the prompt() function to get user input.
    Explored storing user input in variables.
    Practiced displaying user input through alerts and concatenation.
# 10. If Statements
    Learned how to use if statements for conditional logic.
    Explored === operator
