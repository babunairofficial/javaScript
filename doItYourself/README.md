# Learning JavaScript
    This repository tracks my progress as I work through the book "A Smarter Way to Learn JavaScript".

# 1. Alert keyword
    Learned about the alert keyword.
    Practiced creating simple alert dialogs.
# 2. Variables
    Learned how to declare variables using var. (let and const too can be used)
    Practiced assigning values and updating variables.
    Using variables instead of values
# 3. Variables for Numbers
    Learned how to store numeric values in variables.
    Practiced assigning numeric values and updating variables for numbers.
    Learned how alert keyword displays variables assigned to numbers.
# 4. Legal and illegal Variable Names
    Explored legal variable names (e.g., userName, _count, $total).
    Identified illegal variable names (e.g., 2name, my-variable, var).
# 5. Familiar Mathematical Expressions
    Practiced using basic arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %).
# 6. Unfamiliar Mathematical Operators
    Learned about increment (++) and decrement (--) operators.
    Practiced pre-increment (++variable) vs post-increment (variable++).
    note: similar for pre-decrement and post-decrement.  

# How to Use
    Feel free to browse through the code and progress updates. Suggestions and feedback are welcome!
