# Learning JavaScript
    This repository tracks my progress as I work through the book "A Smarter Way to Learn JavaScript".

# 1. Alert keyword
    Learned about the alert keyword.
    Practiced creating simple alert dialogs.
# 2. Variables
    Learned how to declare variables using var. (let and const too can be used)
    Practiced assigning values and updating variables.
    Using variables instead of values
# 3. Variables for Numbers
    Learned how to store numeric values in variables.
    Practiced assigning numeric values and updating variables for numbers.
    Learned how alert keyword displays variables assigned to numbers.
# 4. Legal and illegal Variable Names
    Explored legal variable names (e.g., userName, _count, $total).
    Identified illegal variable names (e.g., 2name, my-variable, var).
# 5. Familiar Mathematical Expressions
    Practiced using basic arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %).
# 6. Unfamiliar Mathematical Operators
    Learned about increment (++) and decrement (--) operators.
    Practiced pre-increment (++variable) vs post-increment (variable++).
    note: similar for pre-decrement and post-decrement.  
# 7. Math Expressions - Eliminating Ambiguity
    Learned how to use parentheses () to control the order of operations.
    Practiced grouping expressions to ensure correct calculations.
    Explored JavaScript's default operator precedence and how to override it.
# 8. Concatenating Text Strings
    Learned how to combine strings using the + operator.
    Explored string concatenation with variables.
    Practiced combining numbers and strings in expressions.
# 9. Prompts
    Learned how to use the prompt() function to get user input.
    Explored storing user input in variables.
    Practiced displaying user input through alerts and concatenation.
# 10. If Statements
    Learned how to use if statements for conditional logic.
    Explored === operator
# 11. Comparison Operators
    Explored equality (===) and inequality (!==).
    Learned other comparison operators like greater than (>), less than (<), greater than or equal to (>=), less than or equal to (<=).
# 12. If...Else and Else If Statements
    Learned how to use if...else for two-way decision-making.
    Practiced using else if for multiple conditions.
# 13. Testing Sets of Conditions
    Learned how to combine multiple conditions using && (AND) and || (OR) operators.
    Explored how logical conditions affect control flow.
    Practiced writing nested and complex conditional statements.
# 14. If Statements Nested
    Learned how to nest if statements inside one another.
    Explored how nested conditions improve program logic.
    Practiced handling multiple decision-making levels.
# 15. Arrays
    Learned how to declare and initialize arrays.
    Explored accessing elements using indexes.
# 16. Adding and Removing elements in Arrays
    Practiced adding elements to already declared array using index number
    Learned how to use push() and pop() for adding and removing elements at the end.
# 17. Arrays - Removing, Inserting, and Extracting Elements
    Explored shift() and unshift() for modifying the beginning of an array.
    Explored how to remove elements from arrays using splice().
    Learned how to insert elements at specific positions using splice(index, 0, value).
    Practiced extracting elements using slice(start, end).
    Understood how slice() creates a shallow copy of the array.
# 18. For Loops
    Learned how to use for loops to iterate over arrays and perform repetitive tasks.
    Explored loop initialization, condition, and increment/decrement expressions.
    Learned how to iterate over arrays and modify their elements.
# 19. For Loops - Flags, Booleans, Array Length, and Loopus Interruptus
    Learned how to use Boolean flags to control loops.
    Explored the concept of breaking out of a loop using break.
    Understood how to use array.length in loops for dynamic iteration.
# 20. For Loops - Nested Loops
    Learned how to use nested for loops for multi-dimensional iteration.
    Explored how inner loops run multiple times for each iteration of the outer loop.
# 21. Changing Case
    Learned how to convert strings to uppercase using toUpperCase().
    Explored converting strings to lowercase using toLowerCase().
